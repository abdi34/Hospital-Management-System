1) Patient Management:
In a Hospital Management System project, the Patient class serves as a crucial entity encapsulating information about individuals seeking medical care. This class typically includes attributes such as patientId, firstName, lastName, gender, age, address, contactNumber, and medicalHistory. These attributes store essential details about the patient, facilitating effective management within the system. The class is designed with encapsulation in mind, employing private access modifiers for attributes and providing public getter and setter methods to control access. Additionally, constructors are implemented to initialize the Patient object with relevant information, allowing for flexibility in instantiation. Beyond basic attributes, the class incorporates methods representing actions a patient can take within the system, such as booking an appointment, checking in, and checking out. These methods encapsulate the logic associated with these actions, contributing to the overall functionality of the Hospital Management System. The design of the Patient class may evolve based on specific project requirements, considering potential relationships with other classes (e.g., doctors, appointments) and accommodating additional features as needed.
3) Doctors Management:
In a Hospital Management System project, the Doctor class plays a pivotal role in encapsulating information related to medical practitioners within the system. The class typically includes attributes such as doctorId, firstName, lastName, specialization, contactNumber, and possibly other relevant details. These attributes store key information about each doctor, aiding in the systematic organization and retrieval of data. The class employs encapsulation principles, marking attributes as private and providing public getter and setter methods to manage access. Constructors are implemented to initialize Doctor objects with necessary information, offering flexibility in instantiation. Beyond basic attributes, the class may include methods representing specific actions a doctor can perform within the system, such as managing patient appointments, updating medical records, or providing treatment plans. The design of the Doctor class should be adaptable, considering potential relationships with other classes, such as patients and appointments, and accommodating additional features as dictated by the specific requirements of the Hospital Management System project. This ensures a comprehensive and scalable representation of the medical staff within the system.
3)Appointment Management:
In the architecture of a Hospital Management System project, the Appointment class serves as a critical component responsible for managing and organizing scheduled appointments between patients and doctors. This class typically includes attributes such as appointmentId, patientId, doctorId, appointmentDateTime, and potentially additional details like the appointment status or any specific notes. These attributes collectively capture essential information related to each appointment instance.

Encapsulation principles are applied to the Appointment class by using private access modifiers for its attributes, with public getter and setter methods providing controlled access to these attributes. Constructors are implemented to initialize instances of the class, facilitating the creation of appointment objects with relevant details.

The Appointment class may also contain methods to perform actions associated with appointments, such as confirming or canceling appointments, checking appointment availability, or generating appointment reminders. Additionally, to enhance the integration of the Hospital Management System, the class should consider relationships with other classes, such as Patient and Doctor, ensuring seamless communication and data flow between different components of the system.

As the requirements of the Hospital Management System evolve, the Appointment class can be adapted to accommodate new features or enhancements. This adaptability ensures that the class remains a versatile and integral part of the system, contributing to the effective management of appointments within the healthcare facility.
